# You'll need to get a credentials.json file and make sure that it lands in the root of the repo.
# You can get the credentials.json by following Step 1 for your service account here:
# https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python
# Then run this file, and you'll get a token.json. That and credentials.json will need to be
# in the root of the repo in order to send emails. Make sure EMAIL_ADDRESS below matches
# that gmail account.

# If you're using this with github actions, make sure that the contents of
# credentials.json are stored as a secret named GMAIL_CREDENTIALS and token.json is stored as
# a secret named GMAIL_TOKEN. The actions will ingest these and use them.
# Make sure to set ALTMETRIC_API_KEY to your Altmetrics API key, and ALTMETRICS_API_SECRET
# to your Altmetrics API secret, both of which you can get from
# https://www.altmetric.com/explorer/documentation/api once you're logged in.
